          “To laugh often and much; to win the respect of the intelligent people
          and the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest
          critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate
          beauty; to find the beauty in others; to leave the world a bit better
          whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social
          condition; to know that one life has breathed easier because you lived
          here. This is to have succeeded.” <br />Ralph Waldo Emerson
